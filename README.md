# elm flexbox 

Flexbox layout in pure elm. 

What is this useful for? well I'm not totally sure yet but here are some thoughs: 

We can bring the elm-ui API to different platforms. Svg is the easiest, but WebGL and Canvas are theoretically possible.
In a future where elm runs on IOS and/or Android, we can transform the tree generated by this package to the underlying API of the platform.

What this ultimately means is that 

- layout on other platforms is delightful
- layout between platforms can be consistent

For now, this is a very low-level thing. It will need various APIs build on top of it to become actually usable.

## Example 

The basic process is to define a `Node` (with various properties and children) and then convert it to a `LayoutNode`, a tree of boxes that represents your layout.

```elm
node : Node
node = 
    Node
        { defaultNode
            | justify_content = JustifyContent.SpaceAround
            , size = { width = Dimension.Points 100, height = Dimension.Points 100 }
            , children =
                [ Node { defaultNode | size = { width = Dimension.Points 10, height = Dimension.Auto } }
                , Node { defaultNode | size = { width = Dimension.Points 10, height = Dimension.Auto } }
                , Node { defaultNode | size = { width = Dimension.Points 10, height = Dimension.Auto } }
                ]
        }


-- unpack the contained record of the default node
defaultNode =
    let
        (Node d) =
            Node.default
    in
    d


Algorithm.compute node Size.undefined
    --> result 

result : LayoutNode 
result = 
    LayoutNode 
        { children = 
            [ LayoutNode { children = [], location = { x = 12, y = 0 }, order = 0, size = { height = 100, width = 10 } }
            , LayoutNode { children = [], location = { x = 45, y = 0 }, order = 0, size = { height = 100, width = 10 } }
            , LayoutNode { children = [], location = { x = 78, y = 0 }, order = 0, size = { height = 100, width = 10 } }
            ]
        , location = { x = 0, y = 0 }
        , order = 0
        , size = { height = 100, width = 100 } 
        }
```


## Notes

This is a port of [visly/stretch](https://github.com/vislyhq/stretch) (written in rust) to elm. It is itself a port of facebook's yoga library (written in c++).
